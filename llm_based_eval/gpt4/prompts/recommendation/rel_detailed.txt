You will be given a set of Korean recommended keywords provided for a specific product.

Your task is to rate the group of recommended keywords on one metric. 

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Relevance (1-5) - Assess how effectively the recommended keywords reflect and highlight key aspects of the product. Consider whether the keywords share a meaningful connection with the raw product.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Begin by carefully reviewing the source product name. Understand its meaning, structure, and inherent implications.
2. Identify the main features or attributes of the product, such as its functionality, target audience, physical characteristics, and any unique selling points.
3. Generate ideas by considering potential synonyms, alternatives, and related phrases that align with the product's attributes. This step should expand the keyword set to encompass broader yet relevant terms.
4. Consider usage scenarios that reflect on situations in which the product would be needed or preferred.
5. Assign a relevance score from 1 to 5. Use the following scale:
    1 = Not Relevant: The keywords have little or no connection to the source product, features, or usage scenarios.
    3 = Moderately Relevant: The keywords relate to the product but may miss some important aspects or fail to capture the product's essence fully.
    5 = Highly Relevant: The keywords excellently reflect and emphasize the source product, features, and potential usage scenarios, offering a comprehensive and accurate depiction.
